# MILTRACK - a military style case variant for the Sentinel AAT.

![Tracker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11336532/193603860-8c03156f-6d07-4565-a948-701d36d66f59.png)

Requires ADDITIONAL components to the standard enclosure as supplied with Sentinel kit
- 2 * 150mm Baert triple feed patch 
- 2 * 150mm RP SMA angled to RP SMA angled pigtail 
- 4 * 6805 2RS bearings
- 20 * M3 10mm ST screw
- 2 * M3 12mm ST screw
- 3.5T or greater sail winch servo ( W5513- 4T JX 4 turn 10kg Standard Metal Gear servo is  )


Caution:
This was designed purely to meet a design spec which is focussed more on aesthetics than usability!
There are few advantages over a standard sentinel tracker - mainly disadvantages:
- Much heavier
- More difficult to transport
- Changing channel / rx access requires removal of upper dome (simply lifts off)
- Case fitment is not optimised - a little trimming may be required
- Slow endpoint crossover change 
Advantages
- Can support much heavier antenna
- smooth pan

Printing:
Print parts as light as you can - especially the top dome and cyclindrical parts. 10% should be OK. As this is a heavy unit, this puts additional pressure on the pan servo. The tilt servo can take more weight than the standard Sentinel as it has lower gearing + bearing supports.
Print the pan servo gear with finest detail as possible. I use 0.08mm high detail at slow speed. Also suggest 20% or higher with 3-5 shells.

This is updated V2 version to use multi turn servo for smooth tracking.
