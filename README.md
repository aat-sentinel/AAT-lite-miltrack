Requires ADDITIONAL components to the standard enclosure as supplied with Sentinel kit
- 2 * 150mm Baert triple feed patch 
- 2 * 150mm RP SMA angled to RP SMA angled pigtail 
- 2 * 6805 2RS bearings
- 20 * M3 10mm ST screw
- 2 * M3 12mm ST screw
- Improved PAN servo. ( can recommend DS3240-270 https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1943129663.html? )


Caution:
This was designed purely to meet a design spec which is focussed more on aesthetics than usability!
There are no advantages over a standard sentinel tracker - mainly disadvantages:
- Much heavier
- More difficult to transport
- Changing channel / rx access requires removal of upper dome (simply lifts off)
- Case fitment is not optimised - a little trimming may be required

Printing:
Print parts as light as you can - especially the top dome and cyclindrical parts. 10% should be OK. As this is a heavy unit, this puts additional pressure on the pan servo. The tilt servo can take more weight than the standard Sentinel as it has lower gearing + bearing supports.
